Project Title - Floody-Hell
A react-Vite-tailwind single page application which uses a postcode search function to plot flood locations within a specific radius onto a polygon map. 
----
Our Motivation - We are a group of four that have been tasked with building an application that demonstrates the skills we have learnt and developed as part of a sixteen week front end coding HTML bootcamp. 

Our Task: Build a single page client-side application project.

Requirments: 
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned to create a real-world client-side single-page application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
Use React.
Use Node.js.
Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
Be deployed using Netlify.
Use at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.
Have a polished front end/UI.
Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
We then were tasked with presenting our project to our peers within our bootcamp

-----
User Story: The user requires information on recent flooding areas and the severity of the flood. The user would find this site beneficial for example if they were in the development industry or were seeking information on flood areas for insurance/relocation purposes. 

----
What we learnt:
- Team communication is key
- We chose to work with tailwind which none of us had done previously
- Using component files in order to build our project as a team
- Futhered our knowledge using apis, fetches, different methods such as 'useState useEffect'.
- How to deploy using Netlify
